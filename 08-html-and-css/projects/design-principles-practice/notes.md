# Design Notes

I looked at [Paul Graham's site](http://paulgraham.com/)

Thoughts:
- the site as a whole looks sad and outdated
- it's not a secure site (http vs https)
- the header doesn't have enough contrast to be legible
- the colors look haphazard and random
- the buttons aren't big enough to be easily clickable on mobile
- overall it could use a better color scheme, more attention to contrast (for legibility) and wider margins and padding
- it isn't responsive at all, resulting in needing to scroll vertically for mobile.
